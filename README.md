# xds
XDS is an acronymn for X as in "unamed" and DS as in Database System. So in essence, XDS stands for the Unamed Database System.

It is a high-level, multi-faceted database architecture which provide client-side functionalities all the way to the server-side, allowing for built-in functionalities, such as:

CRUD-QX API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provide support for CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update and Delete functions), extended with a
Query and eXecute API.

Flexible Model Architecture
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each model is governed by a "Domain:ModelName" naming scheme allowing for a unique model namespace.

All models have a "named" set of properties where each property consists of a type and value. In addition,
meta-data provides additional information for the model and for properties (ie: indexing and enhabced string
support, etc).

The simplistic approach here basically illiminates most boilerplate code (DAO's and DTO's, etc).

Fine-Grained API Control
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every call to the CRUD-QX can be controlled for each invoking user. So for example, you may want to limit
"update" requests on a model family of "MyDomain:MyModel" to a maximum of 1000 calls per hour for the
given user or a set of users.

Or, you may want to limit "create" requests on the domain (all models) of "MyApp:MyDomain:\*" to a maximum
of 1000 per day for the given user or a set of users.

Revisioned Data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provide optional data revisioning for each model. When enabled, will ensure every update is a new entry
and previous revisions are kept (depending on configured auto-purging policies).

Revision 0 always infers to the "latest" (most recent) instance of the model. Revision offset can also be 
used by using a negative number such as -1 (last revision), -2 (second last revision), and so on. Abssolute 
revision numbers can also be used, such as 1 (first every copy), 2 (second update), 33, 55 and so on.

Auto-Sharding and Auto-Replication
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
With a simple configuration, any model can be sharded using a number of strategies (key, hash, range, etc.
or composite configurations). Any model can also easily be replicated n-times.

As part of the sharding/replication architecture, it is relatively simple to configure for "locality" of
the data.

Example replication configuration for the "MyDomain:SomeUser" model:

 >> 1 replication in group "NorthAmerica" and in zone "Zone 1"
 >> 1 replication in group "NorthAmerica" and in zone "Zone 2"
 >> 1 replication in group "Europe" and in zone "\*" (meaning "any" zone such that it will be determined by the system)

ASYNC/Even-Driven API
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every call to the CRUD-QX API is ASYNC and fully event-driven, meaning that the call will return immediately
with a transaction ID. As the request is being fullfilled in-part or in-whole, previously registered events
will be invoked.

Powerful Event-Based Framework
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Events can be registered on entire model domains, model families or specific model instances. This allows
for a very powerful event system. For example, should one want to know if/when a new instance is created
for the "Player" model, a "create" event can be registered on "SomeGame:Player:\*". Every instance created
(server side) would trigger all registered event handlers on every client.

RBAC
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Full "Role Based Access & Control" support is built into the datbase framework, providing for fine-grained
permission control over who can access and do what to each domain, model family, model instance or even
a model's properties.

Flexible, Multi-Level Cacheing
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Built-in per-model caching can be provided for each client configuration and easily configurable on the
server as well. This allows client code to fully optimize at the client-level and also allows for servers
to provide cache optimizations as required without having to provide any code.

API Options
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Every CRUD-QX API provide can receive an optional "options" argument when making a call. These options 
allow to fine-tune the
